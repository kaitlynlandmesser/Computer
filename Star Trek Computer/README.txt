SUMMARY: This is a Star Trek themed natural language processor. It simulates the onboard computer that is featured in the show. It responds to the word “Computer” followed by a command. The user can inquire about the mission, destination, location, crew manifest. The user can also change the mission and destination. The program is written in such a way different words can be used to say the same thing. For example “Locate Admiral Vanscoy” results in the same thing as “Where is Admiral Vanscoy?”
